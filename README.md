# Sliders

A daily challenge game. Slide to the given number and aim to get zero - have a practice and play here - [Sliders Game](https://slidersgame.com)

I built this game as a little challenge for myself while my son was home sick from school. Thanks to YouTube Kids and the Switch for keeping him entertained enough for me to crack on.

In reality, the code needs refactoring, but as time is short, I'm leaving it alone to concentrate on other projects. Feel free to make a clone and tidy it up if you're looking to hone your skills.
